# ChallengeTwo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.10.

If you want to run the node server you need to have done `yarn` before or `npm i` in this folder. After that just execute `npm start`. If you want to run angular built you will need http-server for example to run the html build.

Remember to run this project you need to have running backend-api project

## If I had more time

- I would like to create a shared module for the common components created
- I would like to add lazy loading in each module/page
- I would like to have a better UI
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
